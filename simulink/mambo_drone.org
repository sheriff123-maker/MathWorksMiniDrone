#+TITLE: Parrot Mambo Drone Info :slide:
#+AUTHOR: All data taken from Parrot drone website

Mostly information on what sensor information we have and as a way to document stuff.

* Inertial Measurement Unit
Inertial Measurement Unit to evaluate speed, tilt and obstacle contact
- 3-axis accelerometer
- 3-axis gyroscope

Definitely need to get accurate specs for this.
The Parrot AR Drone had pretty good IMU chips so pretty sure that even a "low-cost" model should have something with:
- accelerometer +-2g
- Bandwidth ~1000Hz
- Low cross-axis misalignment

Not sure how Mathworks's Simulink package deals with the hardware flags but should be interesting to see.

** Accelerometer Characterization
- Bias factor
- Scale factor
- Thermal drift (check if it's relevant? Should be a simple correction)

* Downward facing camera

  60 FPS vertical camera
  120x160 pixel resolution
  Ultrasound sensor

- Do we need to worry about the actual picture being distorted?
  OpenCV has a little camera calibration thingy that takes care of camera distortion.
  A chessboard pattern? Something similar here would be sweet.

* Ultrasound sensor

Useful in determining altitude over a horizontal surface but susceptible to absorption by carpet. Calibrate before trusting.

Might actually be useless? Maybe useful in determing relative distance off the ground and as a way to not have to rely on the downward facing camera while landing.

* Pressure sensor
  As of right now, deemed to be useless!

* Streaming Camera

Streaming and Recording HD 720p 30 FPS
FOV 120Â°

* Physical Characteristics
Need to get a MoI matrix from this
** Weight
Weight: 2.22 oz / 63g (without bumpers or accessories)
Weight with Camera: 73g
** Dimensions
7.1 x 7.1 in. / 18 x 18 cm with Bumpers
** Rotor Characteristics

Right-hand Coordinate Frame centered at Center of gravity.

Rotor #1 rotates positively with respect to the z-axis. It is located parallel to the xy-plane, -45 degrees from the x-axis.

Rotor #2 rotates negatively with respect to the body's z-axis. It is located parallel to the xy-plane, -135 degrees from the x-axis.

Rotor #3 has the same rotation direction as rotor #1. It is located parallel to the xy-plane, 135 degrees from the x-axis.

Rotor #4 has the same rotation direction as rotor #2. It is located parallel to the xy-plane, 45 degrees from the x-axis.
* Miscellaneous
** Energy
660mAh LiPo Battery
8 min autonomy with accessory connected or bumpers
10 min autonomy with neither accessory nor bumpers
30 min charging time with a 2,1A charger

** SDK
SDK: OS Linux. SDK available on Parrot.com
We might find documentation useful, especially if the Simulink model neglects to mention something.
