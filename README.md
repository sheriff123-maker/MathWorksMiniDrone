# Parrot Mambo Drone Info

Mostly information on what sensor information we have and as a way to document stuff.


<a id="org3af9999"></a>

## Sensors


<a id="org60a0542"></a>

### Inertial Measurement Unit

Inertial Measurement Unit to evaluate speed, tilt and obstacle contact

-   3-axis accelerometer
-   3-axis gyroscope

Definitely need to get accurate specs for this.
The Parrot AR Drone had pretty good IMU chips so pretty sure that even a "low-cost" model should have something with:

-   accelerometer +-2g
-   Bandwidth ~1000Hz
-   Low cross-axis misalignment

Not sure how Mathworks's Simulink package deals with the hardware flags but should be interesting to see.

1.  Accelerometer Characterization

    -   Bias factor
    -   Scale factor
    -   Thermal drift (check if it's relevant? Should be a simple correction)

### Ultrasound sensor

Useful in determining altitude over a horizontal surface but susceptible to absorption by carpet. Calibrate before trusting.

Might actually be useless? Maybe useful in determing relative distance off the ground and as a way to not have to rely on the downward facing camera while landing.

### Pressure sensor

As of right now, deemed to be useless!

## Cameras


<a id="org3328419"></a>

### Downward facing camera

60 FPS vertical camera
120x160 pixel resolution
Ultrasound sensor

-   Do we need to worry about the actual picture being distorted?
    OpenCV has a little camera calibration thingy that takes care of camera distortion.
    A chessboard pattern? Something similar here would be sweet.

### Streaming Camera

Streaming and Recording HD 720p 30 FPS
FOV 120Â°


<a id="org78ab3bc"></a>

## Physical Characteristics

Need to get a MoI matrix from this


<a id="orge5fa27c"></a>

### Weight

Weight: 2.22 oz / 63g (without bumpers or accessories)
Weight with Camera: 73g


<a id="org9561dc6"></a>

### Dimensions

7.1 x 7.1 in. / 18 x 18 cm with Bumpers


<a id="org99c709b"></a>

### Rotor Characteristics

![img](./images/screenshot-04.png)

Right-hand Coordinate Frame centered at Center of gravity.

Rotor #1 rotates positively with respect to the z-axis. It is located parallel to the xy-plane, -45 degrees from the x-axis.

Rotor #2 rotates negatively with respect to the body's z-axis. It is located parallel to the xy-plane, -135 degrees from the x-axis.

Rotor #3 has the same rotation direction as rotor #1. It is located parallel to the xy-plane, 135 degrees from the x-axis.

Rotor #4 has the same rotation direction as rotor #2. It is located parallel to the xy-plane, 45 degrees from the x-axis.

## Miscellaneous


<a id="orge5e9251"></a>

### Energy

660mAh LiPo Battery
8 min autonomy with accessory connected or bumpers
10 min autonomy with neither accessory nor bumpers
30 min charging time with a 2,1A charger


<a id="orga11d63b"></a>

### SDK

SDK: OS Linux. SDK available on Parrot.com
We might find documentation useful, especially if the Simulink model neglects to mention something.
