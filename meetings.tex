\subsubsection{Action items summary}
\label{sec:org1d754ce}
\begin{itemize}
\item Finish Onramp training and get software installed and ready

\begin{itemize}
\item Research about drone line-followers would be nice
\end{itemize}
\item Background Research on Control Theory
\begin{itemize}
\item Definitely a bit on the practical side since trusting EEs to make theory simple is a bad move.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Take off from a circular pad
\item Follow a track laid on floor
\begin{itemize}

\subsubsection{SDK}
\label{sec:orga233967}

We might find documentation useful, especially if the Simulink model neglects to mention something.

Right-hand Coordinate Frame centered at Center of gravity.

Rotor \#1 rotates positively with respect to the z-axis. It is located parallel to the xy-plane, -45 degrees from the x-axis.

Rotor \#2 rotates negatively with respect to the body's z-axis. It is located parallel to the xy-plane, -135 degrees from the x-axis.

Rotor \#3 has the same rotation direction as rotor \#1. It is located parallel to the xy-plane, 135 degrees from the x-axis.

Rotor \#4 has the same rotation direction as rotor \#2. It is located parallel to the xy-plane, 45 degrees from the x-axis.

\section{Control\hfill{}\textsc{slide}}
\label{sec:org58a2a5f}
\subsection{Simulink Model Description}
\label{sec:orgbdc0dc7}

\begin{itemize}
\item flight Control system
\item Image processing
\begin{itemize}
\item Loads of OpenCV-like filters
\item Rate Transition since control system runs faster than image processing
\begin{itemize}
\item Any way to create multiple buffers for image processing?
This would allow much better "time resolution"
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Drone Controller
\begin{itemize}
\item Real-time measurement
\end{itemize}
\item Control path planning algorithm
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Sensor Filter}
\label{sec:org7e95304}
Extended Kalman Feedback is what I'm familiar with BUT
\begin{itemize}
\item it's a linear filter, how does it deal with a drone's non-linearities?
Kalman filters assume Gaussian noise on "true" values that are linear-ish
How accurate is this model?
\item Is it even worthwhile to bother with it is a simpler scheme works?
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bfseries\sffamily TODO} How to use vision-based feedback in the correction step?
\label{sec:org2d0a8bf}
Vision-based odometry is apparently a thing for drones.

Contact Dr Mehdi \& Dr Tadhg for vision processing and path planning. \textasciitilde{}Dr Amber

Definitely need to figure out how to use the data after we've manipulated the raw data from the drone camera.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{{\bfseries\sffamily TODO} Control Schemes}
\label{sec:org8240aad}
To be researched. But really need value judgements from a human.

\begin{itemize}
\item PID
\item Fuzzy PID
\item LQR
\item LQG/LTR
\item H-infinity
\item Loop Shaping
\item MPC
\end{itemize}

Perhaps a silly question, can we improve upon a previous run for a given track?
How can we use existing data to contruct a "true-er" model from a previous run (especially at section junction)

\subsection{Sensor Hardware \& Related thoughts}
\label{sec:org8db1624}
\subsubsection{Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)}
\label{sec:org349b6f4}
Inertial Measurement Unit to evaluate speed, tilt and obstacle contact
\begin{itemize}
\item 3-axis accelerometer
\item 3-axis gyroscope
\end{itemize}

Definitely need to get accurate specs for this.
The Parrot AR Drone had pretty good IMU chips so pretty sure that even a "low-cost" model should have something with:
\begin{itemize}
\item accelerometer +-2g
\item Bandwidth \textasciitilde{}1000Hz
\item Low cross-axis misalignment
\end{itemize}

Not sure how Mathworks's Simulink package deals with the hardware flags but should be interesting to see.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Accelerometer Characterization
\label{sec:org7251a69}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bias factor
\item Scale factor
\item Thermal drift (check if it's relevant? Should be a simple correction)
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Downward facing Camera}
\label{sec:org7fdcce9}
60 FPS vertical camera
120x160 pixel resolution

Located near COG and next to the ultrasound sensor.

\begin{itemize}
\item Do we need to worry about the actual picture being distorted?
OpenCV has a little camera calibration thingy that takes care of camera distortion.
A chessboard pattern? Something similar here would be sweet.

\item How do we detect the red path and convert it to a line path?
More of a question for the control scheme but should keep in mind.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item How to do the binary switch for on-off image processing
\label{sec:org1248156}

canny edge to hough processing

canny edge to hough processing

do it for submission

move towards code that focuses on deviation from the center.

Ask Dr Mehdi for help with Mathworks documentations
\end{enumerate}


\section{Image processing summary}
\label{sec:orgf472584}

canny edge > hough transform

inaccuracy in the image or just plain ol' reliability

Also need to figure out if there are better methods out there.

test suite of red track on carpet.

Spepd of camera and te type of communication for the same

FPV camera to predict future paths as well

\section{Application}
\label{sec:orgd23839b}

\begin{itemize}
\item Code generation

\item Forth year and Third year examinations.
\item Sample images from Dr Mehsi after that.

\item 17th Sunday
\end{itemize}
