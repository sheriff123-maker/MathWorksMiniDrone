% Why?

% ORB-SLAM2 is a real-time SLAM library for Monocular, Stereo and RGB-D cameras that computes the camera trajectory and a sparse 3D reconstruction (in the stereo and RGB-D case with true scale). 
% It is able to detect loops and relocalize the camera in real time. 
% We provide examples to run the SLAM system in the KITTI dataset as stereo or monocular, in the TUM dataset as RGB-D or monocular, and in the EuRoC dataset as stereo or monocular. 
% We also provide a ROS node to process live monocular, stereo or RGB-D streams. 
% The library can be compiled without ROS. 
% ORB-SLAM2 provides a GUI to change between a SLAM Mode and Localization Mode, see section 9 of this document.
