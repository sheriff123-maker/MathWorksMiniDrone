# What is this folder for?
This folder is to store all useful research papers in a shared folder.

While I highly recommend the use of Zotero, I also don't want to actually ask you to use it since you probably either have your own setup.


## Message from past Vi that sums up just how much you should trust this :D
So I have zero real knowledge about Control Schemes. And that probably reflects in the literature review I've been doing - it's definitely possible and very likely that I'm missing on a bunch of research because I'm not familiar with field terminology

That said, hope these keywords help you out
- Visual-based
- Line following
- Line Following Robot (LFR)
