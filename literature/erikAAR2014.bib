% Why?
% This work demonstrates some of the computational capabilities of the inexpensive AR.Drone2 quadcopter. 
% Fundamentally a platform that navigates in 3D, the drone offers a clean interface to 2D sensor data through its video stream. 
% By using image-matching to bridge that "interdimensional" gap, this work demonstrates that the drone offers an accessible, compelling platform for research and independent projects at any institution. 
% In the process, we demonstrate that accessible physical platforms, i.e., the drone, the Kinect, and their scaffolding software, ROS, now offer capabilities with much wider curricular and computational applications.
